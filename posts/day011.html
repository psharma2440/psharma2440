		<h2>Explanation:</h2>
		<p>We are making a Dare Game using Go. In game, we ask a different questions to user. <br>
			And based on user choice, we assign dare to him.<br>
			As an output, we display dare and also want the feedback from user.<br></p>
			<h2>Some errors are coming, when I make this dare game:</h2>
			<p>1) If the user is entering the lowercase or mixed case string, it fails to match with "Yes", so I have converted the user input into uppercase and now matching with "YES" to make it correct result.</p>
			<p>2) By default, Readstring reads a new line charcater, so to remove it I have used TrimSpaces function, present in <strong> strings </strong> package</p>
