                        1)Formulation of the problem:
                            a)Output of the problem- To find the Area of the reactangle(area).
                            b)Minimum no. of input require- minimum two input required i.e., length, breadth.
                        2)Input length, breadth.
                        3)Calculate area.
                        4)Area of the reactangle (area) = length * breadth
