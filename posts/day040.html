    <h2>Advantages:-</h2>
    <p>1) Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name.<br>
    2) Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for all its elements.<br>
     Hence there is no chance of extra memory being allocated in case of arrays.<br>
    This avoids memory overflow or shortage of memory in arrays.<br>
    3) In arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using the index number.<br>
    4) Two-dimensional arrays are used to represent matrices.
</p>
<h2>Disadvantages:-</h2>
<p>
    1) The number of elements to be stored in an array should be known in advance.<br>
    2) Allocating more memory than the requirement leads to wastage of memory space and less allocation of memory also leads to a problem.<br>
</p>
<h2>Application:-</h2>
<p>
1) Array stores data elements of the same data type.
2) Maintains multiple variable names using a single name. Arrays help to maintain large data under a single variable name. This avoid the confusion of using multiple variables.
3) Arrays can be used for sorting data elements. Different sorting techniques like Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort etc use arrays to store and sort elements easily.
4) Arrays can be used for performing matrix operations. Many databases, small and large, consist of one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays whose elements are records.
5) Arrays can be used for CPU scheduling. 
6) Lastly, arrays are also used to implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash tables etc.
